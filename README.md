# 📊 Manufacturing Analytics with Power BI
### Supplementing Excel with visual, automated insights

This repository contains a collection of **Power BI** reports designed to support **manufacturing operations** through clearer, faster, and more interactive analysis. While **Excel** remains essential for data entry, ad‑hoc calculations, and quick checks, **Power BI** adds a presentation layer that transforms raw data into **insightful dashboards** for production and quality reviews.

## 🎯 Purpose
Manufacturing generates large volumes of operational and quality data. Excel is great for capture and manipulation, but it can be limiting when teams need:

- **Automated updates** and refreshable models  
- **Visual performance tracking** (KPIs, trends, comparisons)  
- **Interactive drilldowns** without cluttering slides  
- **Consistent storytelling** for stand‑ups, huddles, and exec reviews

Power BI bridges the gap by connecting to your data, modeling relationships, and presenting information in a way that’s easy to interpret during meetings and decision‑making sessions.
